                <p class="mb-5">
                    Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am Tejas, a passionate and dedicated doctoral research scholar
                    at the School
                    of Infrastructure, Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, specializing in sustainable
                    construction materials.
                    My academic journey has been both enriching and inspiring. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Civil
                    Engineering and a
                    Master’s degree in Structural Engineering, both of which have sparked my curiosity and equipped me
                    for the
                    challenges of advanced research. My research focuses on the design and development of
                    alkali-activated concrete
                    under the guidance of Prof. Dinakar Pasla. I have been honoured with the prestigious Prime
                    Minister’s Research
                    Fellowship (PMRF) to pursue my doctoral studies, with a focus on advancing sustainable construction
                    materials.
                    Beyond my research, I am deeply passionate about teaching and knowledge sharing. I’ve had the
                    privilege of
                    instructing and mentoring undergraduate students in subjects like Solid Mechanics, Structural
                    Analysis, and
                    Construction Materials. I strongly believe that effective teaching and mentorship are integral to a
                    fulfilling and
                    impactful academic career. My research interests include Concrete Technology, Durability studies,
                    Microstructural
                    characterization,
                    Waste minimization and utilization, and Repair and rehabilitation. My primary research goal is to
                    develop sustainable building materials for a wide range of civil
                    engineering applications. With the construction industry facing increasing pressure to reduce its
                    carbon
                    footprint, my current work investigates fully replacing Portland-cement concretes with
                    alkali-activated alternatives
                    derived from aluminosilicate-rich industrial by-products and agricultural waste ashes. By leveraging
                    fly ash, slag, and similar precursors, these materials can dramatically lower CO₂ emissions and help
                    mitigate the environmental impact of construction projects. I am enthusiastic about advancing the
                    frontiers of sustainable construction materials and welcome opportunities for research
                    collaboration—please feel free to connect!

                                    characterization</h3>
                                <p>There is a steep increase in demand for concrete as the need for infrastructure is
                                    increasing with a rapid increase in
                                    urbanization. Consequently, there has been a surging demand for cement across the
                                    globe. By using alkaline concrete
                                    activated with ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), cement usage can be
                                    eliminated in concrete, which addresses
                                    the issue of CO2 emissions concerned with the cement manufacturing process and
                                    promotes the use of industrial
                                    by-products as sustainable building materials. The current study focuses on
                                    proposing a methodology to design
                                    sustainable GGBS-based alkali-activated concrete incorporated with 100 % coarse
                                    recycled coarse aggregates (RCA)
                                    recovered from construction and demolition (C&D) waste, for various strengths by
                                    optimizing the mix proportions and
                                    verifying the same through experiments. From the current study, it is evident that
                                    this mix design procedure can be
                                    adopted to design alkali-activated slag recycled aggregate concrete (AASRAC) mixes
                                    for strengths ranging from 44 MPa to
                                    85 MPa. The optimum values of alkalinity factor (λ) and NaOH concentration (M) i.e.,
                                    1.5 and 12, have a significant role
                                    in the development of high strengths which is attributed to the formation of
                                    hydrotalcite. Micrographs captured using
                                    scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
                                    studies reveal that the alkaline
                                    binders promote the development of a denser and stronger interfacial transition zone
                                    (ITZ) that enhances the strength of
                                    lower AA/B concretes at the microstructural level as Ca/Si ratio is higher for lower
                                    AA/B concretes. Global warming
                                    potential (GWP) analysis reveals that the alkali-activated concretes have
                                    significantly lower GWP compared to
                                    conventional OPC-based concrete by approximately 2.5 times. The mix-design chart
                                    proposed in this study may pave the way
                                    to designing structural grade AASRAC with enhanced performance for the desired
                                    strength, which may find its application
                                    in fast-track construction and manufacturing of prefabricated elements.</p>

                                    a microstructural perspective</h3>
                                <p>Using cement-based natural aggregate concretes to meet the increasing infrastructural
                                    demands has determinantal effects
                                    on the environment, such as CO2 emissions due to cement manufacturing and
                                    degradation of natural resources. The present
                                    study aims to find the optimum replacement content of two agricultural wastes i.e.,
                                    sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA), and
                                    rice husk ash (RHA) to be incorporated in alkali-activated slag concrete developed
                                    from ground granulated blast furnace
                                    slag (GGBS), along with 100% recycled coarse aggregates (RCA). Four concretes each
                                    for SBA and RHA were prepared by
                                    replacing them with GGBS from 5% to 20% at the steps of 5%. Compressive strength and
                                    water absorption parameters were
                                    used to evaluate the influence of SBA and RHA in alkali-activated slag recycled
                                    aggregate concrete (AASRAC) for all
                                    eight concretes. These macro properties were justified at the micro-level by SEM–EDS
                                    and XRD analysis. From the present
                                    study, it was found that 10% SBA (S10) and 10% RHA (R10) replaced with GGBS
                                    exhibited a maximum strength of 69 MPa and
                                    66 MPa and minimum water absorption of 1.97% and 2.12% respectively, compared to
                                    other concretes developed in the study.
                                    The formation of highly polymerized and condensed products due to enhanced
                                    reactivity of the precursor and the highest
                                    Ca/Si and Ca/(Si + Al) for both S10 and R10 mixes resulted in the increased
                                    structural buildup of the cross-linked
                                    tobermorite-like structures, leading to the formation of a condensed C-(A)-S-H gel
                                    structure. Thus, it was concluded
                                    from the study that the optimum replacement % of SBA and RHA in AASRAC is 10%.</p>

                                <h3>Assessment of mechanical and durability properties of composite cement-based
                                    recycled aggregate concrete</h3>
                                <p>The decade 2014–2024 is known as the sustainable decade, as a result of which there
                                    is a need to develop eco-friendly
                                    building materials and adopt sustainable construction practices. Utilizing larger
                                    proportions of industrial by-products
                                    reduces the carbon footprint on the environment caused by the cement manufacturing
                                    process. Also, the demand for natural
                                    aggregates is surging rapidly, hence recycled aggregates or recycled concrete coarse
                                    aggregates are being used as an
                                    alternative to natural aggregates. But there is a lack of studies based on the
                                    utilization of composite cement (fly ash
                                    and slag as blending materials) along with 100% recycled concrete aggregates. In the
                                    present study composite
                                    cement-based, recycled aggregate concrete is developed for varying water-cement
                                    ratios of 0.3 to 0.7 for 100%
                                    replacement of natural aggregates with recycled concrete coarse aggregates. These
                                    concretes were studied for mechanical
                                    properties and durability properties like water permeability, chloride ion
                                    permeability, corrosion resistance and
                                    resistance to carbonation. It is concluded from the current study that; the
                                    developed concrete consisting of 100% RCA
                                    and composite cement exhibits compressive strength between 25 MPa and 60 MPa for
                                    decreasing w/c from 0.7 to 0.3
                                    respectively. Also, a well-designed mix with dense aggregate grading, ensures that
                                    the carbonation exhibited by this
                                    concrete is negligible and satisfies all the durability requirements. Hence it can
                                    be employed in the real-time
                                    construction of buildings.</p>

                                    sustainable construction materials</h3>
                                <p>Contemporary society has witnessed a significant surge in construction activities to
                                    cater to the expanding needs of the
                                    populace. The scarcity of natural resources has resulted in a predicament for the
                                    construction industry, as it
                                    encounters difficulties in obtaining high-grade fine aggregates. The present study
                                    investigates the feasibility of using
                                    bauxite residue (BR) as a partial replacement of natural sand for fine aggregates,
                                    to develop structural concrete. The
                                    first phase of the present study aims to find the optimum replacement content of BR
                                    as a partial replacement for natural
                                    sand as fine aggregates. In the second phase, a wide spectrum of concrete consisting
                                    of 20 % optimum BR content as fine
                                    aggregates (BRC20 concrete) with a w/c ratio ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 was developed,
                                    and their mechanical and long-term
                                    performance was investigated. It was observed that BRC20 concretes exhibited a
                                    strength 1.2 times higher than the
                                    control concrete mix due to the development of a dense microstructure and increased
                                    particle packing. Substitution of BR
                                    as fine aggregates in concrete is a viable option for structural concrete as all the
                                    test results fall within the
                                    prescribed limits outlined by the various codes of practice. These BRC20 concretes
                                    find their application in mainstream
                                    construction activities such as the construction of structural members for
                                    residential buildings. Applications extend to
                                    self-compacting concrete, where red mud acts as a viscosity-modifying agent, and in
                                    the production of concrete blocks
                                    and pavers for non-structural uses. These applications not only address
                                    environmental concerns associated with red mud
                                    disposal but also promote the development of innovative and eco-friendly
                                    construction materials.</p>

                                <h3>Characteristics of crushed and alternative fine aggregates based on flow, shear and
                                    impact behaviour</h3>
                                <p>Crushed sand has been found to be an excellent replacement for river sand as the
                                    latter is not readily available. As a
                                    part of sustainable construction methods and practices, industrial by- products such
                                    as copper slag, cinder etc., can be
                                    used as alternative sands. In this work, an attempt has been made to study the
                                    performance of crushed stone sand for its
                                    flow properties based on large sample analysis. For this, 30 samples of crushed sand
                                    were procured from different
                                    sources. In addition, few alternative sands were also considered for the analysis
                                    which included copper slag, Ennore
                                    sand and two types of cinders. The parameters tested are flow time based on New
                                    Zealand flow cone, loose bulk density,
                                    uncompacted voids and specific gravity. In order to enhance the performance of the
                                    poor crushed sand, different samples
                                    of crushed sands were blended which results in acceptable flow characteristics.
                                    Similar exercise was done for
                                    alternative sands by considering double or triple blending which finally resulted in
                                    good flow properties for possible
                                    use in concrete. In addition, few samples were also tested and evaluated for their
                                    shear and impact behaviour.
                                    Conclusions are drawn based on the results obtained.</p>

                                <h3>Performance evaluation of crushed stone sand for its characterization based on large
                                    sample analysis</h3>
                                <p>In the present work and attempt has been made to characterise the crushed stone and
                                    based on its engineering properties
                                    and to interpret the result, statically. For this 30 crushed sand samples from
                                    various sources are collected and tested
                                    for their properties. Laboratory tests are conducted as per relevant BIS codes of
                                    practice. Gradation of aggregate is
                                    characterised by plotting green size distribution curves in Excel software based on
                                    sieve and analysis tests. For this
                                    purpose, set of 9 sieves starting from 10 mm to 38 micro meters are used. From these
                                    curves, various parameters such as
                                    zoning amount of fine finest modulus, uniformity, coefficient, and coefficient of
                                    curvature are determined. Amount of
                                    deleterious materials as function of particles fine than 75 micro meter is
                                    determined from both wet and dry sieving as
                                    per the code of practice. In addition, a detailed study is made to understand and
                                    interpret the saturated and surface
                                    dry conditions of the aggregate. Based on this condition, the water absorption of
                                    all samples is determined and the
                                    results are reported. All results are analyzed, statistically and few conclusions
                                    are drawn.</p>

                                    State-of-the-Art Review</h3>
                                <p>The notion of IoT, also known as the Internet of Things, has been there for many
                                    years, but recent technical progress
                                    has elevated its prominence. The increasing need for creative ideas, approaches, and
                                    technology is driven by the fast
                                    evolution of our world today. The construction sector has enthusiastically adopted
                                    the IoT as an advanced technology to
                                    develop intelligent structures, enhance resource efficiency, and manage construction
                                    expenses. One of the main benefits
                                    of incorporating IoT into construction operations is the notable advantage of being
                                    able to gather and analyse real-time
                                    data. The use of IoT technologies in the construction industry can greatly augment
                                    productivity and efficiency. This
                                    review article examines the IoT and its applications in different fields of the
                                    civil engineering and construction
                                    industry. It investigates the advantages of IoT in this sector and explores how it
                                    is implemented.</p>

                            fracture and fatigue failure in solids</div>
                        <p>This study introduces a consistent mode-dependent phase-field model (PFM) for brittle failure
                            under both mechanical and electro-mechanical
                            loading conditions. The proposed framework will facilitate the topology optimization of
                            smart materials, aiming to minimize structural
                            weight while enhancing fracture strength. Currently, a mode-dependent PFM for brittle
                            fracture under mechanical loads is developed by
                            proposing mode-factor dependent degradation functions that incorporate the effect of two
                            additional fracture parameters, namely the
                            mode-II critical energy release rate and mode-II fracture strength, on the overall
                            mechanical response. Using the proposed mode-factor
                            dependent degradation functions and employing a recently proposed modified strain
                            decomposition scheme, analytical expressions for the
                            mode-I and mode-II fracture strengths are provided corresponding to the mode-dependent parts
                            of the elastic energy. Mode-dependent
                            driving forces are proposed by adopting a modified Benzeggagh-Kenane (B-K) criteria and
                            deriving expressions for the critical energy
                            release rate corresponding to individual fracture modes. The proposed model provides a
                            consistent coupling between the different
                            fracture modes and can thus predict fracture for all possible mode-mixity ratios. A
                            parametric study is carried out to unravel the
                            effect of mixed-mode fracture parameters on the mechanical response of isotropic materials
                            by considering a few representative
                            numerical examples. The numerical results from the proposed model show an excellent
                            agreement with experimental results reported
                            in the literature. Moreover, results have been generated for the case of fatigue failure in
                            materials under mechanical and
                            electro-mechanical loading conditions, which can be extended for the development of
                            mode-dependent fracture models.
                            The fatigue effect has been characterized by introducing a degradation function that
                            regulates the evolution of the phase
                            field variable. The obtained results under both cyclically applied displacement and electric
                            potential are demonstrated.

                            interfaces and brittle fracture </div>
                        <p>The development of high-performance bio-inspired composites is one of the contemporary topics
                            of research interest. Experiments on
                            composites made of constituents with contrasting material properties and thus possessing a
                            distinct material interface have shown
                            very promising results in terms of having high strength and high toughness. To the best of
                            author's knowledge, although several analytical
                            studies on the functionally graded in-homogeneous plates with material properties varying in
                            exponential or power series manner are
                            available in the literature, there is no analytical method to find a closed-form solution
                            for composites with a distinct material
                            interface. Because of the unavailability of analytical methods, finite element solutions are
                            extensively used for the analysis of these
                            problems. However, validation of the finite element solution for composites with material
                            interface against benchmark problems will
                            increase the confidence. In this work, a diffused material interface-based novel method is
                            proposed for finding analytical solutions
                            for the elastic deformation in composites with in-plane homogeneity that can be used as
                            benchmark problems for the validation of the
                            finite element solutions. In the proposed analytical method, the material interface is
                            diffused using a Gaussian kernel function and
                            derived expressions for the material properties that are smooth, i.e, functions and their
                            derivatives are continuous, in the entire
                            domain. The Galerkin method is used to solve the governing partial differential equations
                            for the derived smooth material properties.
                            The efficacy of the proposed analytical approach is demonstrated through illustrative
                            examples on the composite bar, beam, and plates
                            with in-plate inhomogeneities. Also, a combined diffused material interface and hybrid
                            phase-field model is proposed for
                            modeling micro-fracture evolution in heterogeneous composites. Here, analytical expressions
                            for the regularized properties at the
                            material interface are derived from the matrix and inclusions properties by using a recently
                            proposed diffused material interface
                            method. To model de-bonding at the material interface or cracks in the matrix or inclusion,
                            the phase-field model, a continuum diffused
                            crack approach, that provides the crack path as a solution to partial differential equations
                            is used and thus bypasses the requirement
                            of tracking individual cracks, enrichment of shape-functions or re-meshing during crack
                            propagation. An open-source implementation of
                            the proposed combined model is proposed using a recently developed finite element toolbox,
                            Gridap in Julia. The proposed model and its
                            implementation is validated against experimental results on complicated de-bonding and
                            kinking micro-crack paths in quasi-brittle
                            materials.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
                <p>My primary interest is rooted to develop sustainable building materials which are used in various
                    civil engineering
                    applications. The decade 2014-2024 is known as the sustainable decade, there is a huge demand for
                    the development of
                    sustainable materials and adopt sustainable construction practices. My current research deals with
                    the studies related
                    to replacing Portland cement-based concretes completely with alkali-activated concretes, developed
                    by alkali activation
                    methods, which utilizes aluminosilicate-rich precursors derived from industrial byproducts and
                    agricultural waste ashes.
                    The main focus of the current research is to significantly lower CO2 emissions as alkali-activated
                    materials utilize
                    industrial by-products such as fly ash or slag, which have a much lower carbon footprint. Using
                    alkali-activated
                    materials in construction projects can help mitigate the environmental impact of the construction
                    industry and
                    contribute to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">Beyond research, I am fervent about pursuits that enhance both physical and mental
                    well-being. I am passionate about
                    playing lawn tennis, badminton and cricket. Walking and cycling provide a revitalising method to
                    maintain physical
                    activity and engage with the natural environment. Rom-Com movies serve as a source of amusement for
                    me. Eventually,
                    listening to melodious music serves as a perpetual companion, providing both calm and inspiration
                    for creativity.
